# Texture Analysis

This part of the project analyses XRD patterns to quantify the amount of texture (non-random orientation of crystallites) involved in them.
Texture changes the relative height of the peaks in the diffractogram. Therefore, the ratio of the area of the two biggest peaks 
in the diffractogram is used for quantification.
